# ARPokemon3D
Visualise Pokemon cards with Augmented Reality.

NOTE: Requires A9 chip or more (iPhone 5 SE, iPhone 6S and above) 

How it works:

- Print the Pokemon cards eevee-card.png and oddish-card.png
- Open the app and point the camera to the cards
- The 2 Pokemons become 3D images sticking to the cards.
